Move _setup_*.py to respective directory.
Move compilation.py to its own package (for use in symneqsys)

There is a bug(confirm it is still there) in GSL_IVP_Integrator (or rather the generated C-code or driver.c) which
causes integration sometimes to fail with singular matrix. Runs are inconsisteent - suggesting that some array is not initiliazed to zero (or data is being read outside bounds)

Refactor gsl.integrator to use codegen (and factor out general bits)
Add sundials
Add odeint (www.odeint.com C++ library which exploits OpenCL)
Pure root finding module, similiar syntax?

There is a bug in GSL driver which produces different results on different runs, it
is not due to not assigning zero to elements of dydt in jac() (established). The
reason is currently unknown..


Long-term:
==========
DAE functionality
